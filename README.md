# Memory Game

Welcome to Memory Game! The objective of this game is to match all cards with their duplicate. There are 9 pairs total. Once logged in, you will click on two crads. If the cards match, they will stay visible. If they do not match, the cards will turn back over. Click on more cards until all matches are uncovered. The goal is to match all cards in the fastest time possible. Good luck!
